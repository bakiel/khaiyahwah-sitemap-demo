                <p>
                    The <strong>Feast of Shavuot (Shavuote)</strong> is a joyous celebration commemorating the giving of the Law (Torah) to Moses on Mount Sinai. For the African Hebrew Israelites, this Holy Day holds additional significance, connecting the ancient revelation of divine law with the modern establishment of Kingdom laws and governance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community observes Shavuote with vibrant <strong>community celebrations</strong>, often featuring music, dance, special meals (following Genesis Nutrition), and gatherings that reaffirm their commitment to living by Yah's commandments.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    This feast is particularly connected with the historic gathering on the <strong>Mountain of Life (Har Kayeem)</strong> in 1971, where the Divine Council was established and the foundations for applying divine law within the community were laid. Shavuote serves as an annual reminder of the importance of divine law as the basis for a righteous society and the ongoing revelation of Yah's will for His people.
