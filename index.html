                    For centuries, the children of Israel languished in spiritual death, scattered to the four corners of the earth as foretold by the prophets. Stripped of identity, disconnected from heritage, and bound in mental captivity, we endured the curses described in Deuteronomy 28—the bitter fruit of disobedience. Yet even in our darkest hour, Yah never abandoned His covenant.

                    In February 1966, the Angel Gabriel appeared to H.E. Ben Ammi with divine instructions: "It is time to start the journey back to the promised land and to establish the long awaited kingdom of God that had been prophesied by Daniel the prophet in the second chapter and the 44th verse. And the year of the Exodus will be 1967."
                </p>
                <p>
                    This 45-second vision ignited a flame that would lead hundreds from America to Liberia and finally to the Holy Land—fulfilling the prophetic timeline with remarkable precision. After nearly 400 years in captivity, the children of Israel have returned home.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            In February 1966, as H.E. Ben Ammi lay deeply troubled by the predicament of his people in America, the Angel Gabriel appeared with a divine message that would change history:
                        </p>
                        <div class="quote mb-4">
                            <p>"It is time to start the journey back to the promised land and to establish the long awaited kingdom of God that had been prophesied by Daniel the prophet in the second chapter and the 44th verse. And the year of the Exodus will be 1967."</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            This 45-second vision contained the blueprint for liberation—a divine mandate to return to the Holy Land and establish Yah's Kingdom on earth. It came at a pivotal moment when social upheaval was sweeping across America, with riots erupting in cities nationwide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a massive snowstorm blanketed Chicago in January 1967, H.E. Ben Ammi saw it as divine confirmation: "As I walked out of my home on that morning, it appeared as if the entire world stood still, for all of the great awesome power of the Gentiles had been brought to naught by an accumulation of little snowflakes."

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            In April 1967, approximately 400 Hebrew Israelites departed America for Liberia, marking the beginning of their prophetic exodus. This departure occurred almost exactly 400 years after the first Africans were brought to American shores in 1619, fulfilling the biblical timeline of captivity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Led by H.E. Ben Ammi, these pioneers left behind comfort, possessions, and familiarity to follow divine guidance. They sold homes, quit jobs, and said goodbye to loved ones, believing wholeheartedly in the vision of returning to their ancestral homeland.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            The Liberian wilderness served as a crucible for spiritual purification, testing the resolve of the Hebrew Israelites through extreme physical challenges. They faced venomous snakes, torrential monsoon rains, tropical diseases, and the difficult transition from urban American life to subsistence farming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These hardships served a divine purpose—to burn away the "mentality of Babylon" and prepare the Saints for their ultimate destination in the Holy Land. Many who began the journey turned back, unable to endure these trials, but those who persevered emerged spiritually strengthened and unified.

                            On August 19, 1969, Prince Gavriel, along with Emah Tekia and their son Benainu, became the first family to immigrate from Liberia to Israel. This historic arrival marked the beginning of the prophetic return that would bring thousands of Hebrew Israelites back to the land of their ancestors after nearly 2,000 years of exile.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            The early settlers established themselves first in Arad before expanding to Dimona and Mitzpeh Ramon. Despite limited resources and an uncertain welcome, these pioneers laid the foundation for what would become a thriving community.

                            On October 24, 1971, as the sun rose over the Judean hills, the Saints gathered on what would become known as Har Kayeem (Mountain of Life) in Dimona. This historic assembly marked the establishment of divine governance in the Holy Land—the first true expression of righteous leadership on earth in nearly 2,000 years.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Following the pattern established by Moses under Jethro's counsel (Exodus 18), H.E. Ben Ammi appointed twelve Princes to form the Divine Council. Each Prince received a spiritual title reflecting their divine purpose, creating the governance structure that would guide the community through the challenges ahead.

                            For many years, the community faced significant legal challenges regarding their status in Israel. Many Saints experienced deportations, employment difficulties, and the constant pressure of building a new society in an unwelcoming environment.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Despite these obstacles, the community remained focused on establishing their Kingdom institutions—the House of Life, Kingdom School in Holiness, and various self-sustaining enterprises. They maintained their distinctive cultural practices, Genesis Nutrition, and spiritual observances despite external pressure.

                            In 1990, after exactly twenty years—a biblically significant period of testing—the Israeli government granted our community members B-1 work visas, beginning the process of legal recognition. This breakthrough came through persistent diplomacy, growing recognition of our positive contributions to Israeli society, and ultimately, divine timing in fulfillment of prophecy.

                            "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat." —Genesis 1:29

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            In 1971, the African Hebrew Israelite community embraced a revelation that would transform our physical and spiritual wellbeing—a return to the original diet prescribed by Yah in Genesis. This preventative and regenerative approach has eliminated common diseases and created generations of vibrant, healthy Saints.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Our Genesis Nutrition system focuses not merely on treating illness but on preventing disease through living foods that regenerate the body at the cellular level. Unlike the Western "death-style" that degenerates health over time, our plant-based approach actively restores vitality, reverses damage, and maintains optimal function throughout life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through decades of implementation, we've witnessed remarkable health transformations, including children born and raised in the community who have never experienced common Western diseases and elders who maintain active, vibrant lifestyles well into their golden years.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            On October 24, 1971, the establishment of the Divine Council marked the return of righteous governance on earth. Following the pattern established by Moses under Jethro's counsel (Exodus 18), H.E. Ben Ammi appointed twelve Princes to form the Divine Council.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Each Prince received a spiritual title reflecting their divine purpose:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">

                            <li>Prince Hezkiyahoo – Prince of Patience</li>
                            <li>Prince Eliezer – Elder Prince and Priest, Prince of Wisdom</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Unlike the corrupted governments of the world, the Divine Council operates according to principles of righteousness, transparency, and spiritual insight, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah 1:26: "And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning."

                            The Kingdom School in Holiness serves as the educational foundation for our community, preserving young minds from the corrupting influences of worldly education systems. Our approach integrates spiritual formation with academic excellence, teaching children not just what to think but how to think righteously.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Young Saints receive instruction in Hebrew language and culture, Kingdom principles, and practical skills alongside traditional academic subjects. This holistic approach ensures they develop both intellectual capacity and spiritual discernment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our educational philosophy recognizes that true knowledge begins with the fear of Yah and that wisdom comes through aligning our understanding with divine principles rather than corrupted human paradigms.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Marriage in the Kingdom transcends mere social convention, serving as a sacred covenant relationship with profound spiritual purpose. Our marriages are built on complementary roles, mutual respect, and shared commitment to establishing Yah's righteousness on earth.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Unlike the degraded concept of marriage prevalent in Western society, Kingdom marriages focus on spiritual harmony, righteous child-rearing, and the advancement of the community. Every household serves as a microcosm of the Kingdom itself, with clear structure and purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through strong marriages and family units, we ensure the preservation and transmission of our heritage, values, and spiritual understanding to future generations, maintaining the covenant across time.

                            The Sabbath (Shabbat) stands as the most honored of the High Holy Days, a day of spiritual communion with Yah through fasting, meditation, and sanctification. From sunset Friday to sunset Saturday, the Saints enter a sacred time set apart from worldly concerns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unlike the surrounding society that treats Sabbath as a feast day, we observe it with fasting from food and water, following the example of ancient prophets. During this holy time, all nourishment comes from spiritual sustenance, not physical food.

                            Passover commemorates both the ancient deliverance from Egyptian bondage and our modern exodus from America in 1967. This powerful observance connects past and present, reminding us of Yah's consistent work of liberation across generations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our Passover celebration includes a ceremonial meal, recounting of the exodus story, and special prayers. We recognize that just as Yah passed over the houses of Israel in ancient times, He has preserved us through our modern journey from captivity to freedom.

                            The Day of Atonement stands as our most solemn holy day, a time of deep spiritual reflection, repentance, and renewal. For a full 24 hours, we abstain completely from food and water, focusing our entire being on spiritual cleansing and reconciliation with Yah.

                            This sacred day includes extended prayer, confession of sins (both individual and collective), and commitment to walking more perfectly in Yah's ways. It serves as an annual spiritual reset, allowing us to enter the new year with renewed purpose and purified hearts.

                            The Feast of Tabernacles connects us to both the ancient Israelites' wilderness journey and our own community's experience in Liberia.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Prince Gavriel Ha Gadol, known as the "Prince of Love," stands among the foundational pioneers of Yah's Kingdom on earth. His life embodies the transformation from spiritual death to resurrection that defines the African Hebrew Israelite journey.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Born George Butler on February 28, 1937, in Delhi, Louisiana during the latter years of the Great Depression, Prince Gavriel's early life reflected the experiences of many African Americans in the segregated South—close family bonds amid challenging circumstances.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        On August 19, 1969, Prince Gavriel, along with Tekia and their son Benainu, became the first family to immigrate from Liberia to Israel, marking the beginning of the prophetic return to the Holy Land. This historic journey completed the pattern established by the ancient Israelites—from bondage to wilderness to promised inheritance.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Upon settling in Israel, Prince Gavriel was appointed as one of the twelve Princes of the Divine Council in 1971, receiving the spiritual title "Prince of Love." His contributions to the community included the introduction of healing herbs like fenugreek (which he named "Love Powder") and development of nutritional approaches that transformed community health.

We were ex-Negroes from America's ghettos—people systematically stripped of identity, dignity, and strength. Now we stand as Hebrew Israelites firmly established in the Holy Land, unbroken despite decades of opposition. This transformation is the true miracle."

                        In February 1966, H.E. Ben Ammi received a divine vision from the Angel Gabriel instructing him to lead the people back to the Promised Land. The message was clear: "It is time to start the journey back to the promised land and to establish the long awaited kingdom of God that had been prophesied by Daniel the prophet in the second chapter and the 44th verse. And the year of the Exodus will be 1967."
                        <br><br>
                        This revelation coincided with the prophetic timeline described in Scripture, which indicated that after approximately 400 years in captivity (from 1619 to 1967), the children of Israel would return to their homeland. The social upheaval in America during 1967—widespread riots, civil unrest, and a massive snowstorm in Chicago that H.E. Ben Ammi saw as divine confirmation—created the conditions for this prophetic exodus to unfold exactly as foretold.

                        Our identity as Hebrew Israelites was revealed through both divine revelation and scriptural study. When we examined passages like Deuteronomy 28, which describes the curses that would befall Israel for disobedience, we recognized our own historical experience of slavery, oppression, and identity loss perfectly described in these prophecies.
                        <br><br>
                        Deuteronomy 28:68 specifically mentions the children of Israel being taken back into Egypt (symbolizing bondage) in ships—a clear reference to the transatlantic slave trade. The scripture goes on to say they would be sold as bondmen and bondwomen with "none to buy you" (or redeem you), exactly matching our experience in chattel slavery where we were property with no redemption rights.
                        <br><br>
                        Our identity was not something we invented but something we recovered through divine revelation and careful study of Scripture, archaeology, and history—all of which confirmed that the descendants of the transatlantic slave trade were indeed the children of Israel in exile, precisely as prophesied.

                        Genesis Nutrition is our community's approach to diet and health based on Genesis 1:29: "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat."

                        Our establishment in Israel followed a prophetic pattern of testing and vindication. The first arrivals in 1969 settled initially in Arad before expanding to Dimona and Mitzpeh Ramon. For twenty years (1970-1990), we faced significant legal challenges, deportations, and opposition.
                        <br><br>
                        During this testing period, we remained focused on building our community institutions—the House of Life (natural birthing center), Kingdom School in Holiness, and various self-sustaining enterprises. We maintained our distinctive cultural practices, Genesis Nutrition, and spiritual observances despite external pressure.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1990, after exactly twenty years—a biblically significant period of testing—the Israeli government granted our community members B-1 work visas, beginning the process of legal recognition. This breakthrough came through persistent diplomacy, growing recognition of our positive contributions to Israeli society, and ultimately, divine timing in fulfillment of prophecy.
