                <!-- FAQ Item 1 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2 class="faq-question text-xl">What does it mean to be a Hebrew Israelite?</h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Being a Hebrew Israelite means recognizing our identity as the descendants of the ancient Israelites described in the Bible. For the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, this involves reclaiming our heritage, culture, and connection to the Holy Land after centuries of dispersion and captivity, particularly the transatlantic slave trade which scattered our ancestors. It is a spiritual and cultural identity rooted in adherence to the laws and commandments of Yah.

                <!-- FAQ Item 2 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2 class="faq-question text-xl">Why did the community leave America?</h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        The departure from America in 1967 was prompted by a divine vision received by our spiritual leader, H.E. Ben Ammi Ben-Israel. This vision instructed him to gather the children of Israel scattered in America (the land of their captivity, often referred to as "spiritual Egypt") and lead them back to the Promised Land (Israel) to establish the Kingdom of Yah. This exodus was seen as a direct fulfillment of biblical prophecy concerning the end of a 400-year period of affliction (Genesis 15:13) and the beginning of the prophesied return.

                 <!-- FAQ Item 3 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2 class="faq-question text-xl">What is Genesis Nutrition?</h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Genesis Nutrition is the community's plant-based dietary system based on Genesis 1:29 ("Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed... and every tree... to you it shall be for meat."). It is a vegan diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and herbs, excluding all animal products and processed foods. It's viewed not just as a diet for physical health but as a spiritual discipline that promotes clarity, prevents disease, and aligns the body with divine law. It includes practices like No Salt Days, Live Food Days/Weeks, and Sugarless Weeks.

                 <!-- FAQ Item 4 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2 class="faq-question text-xl">What are some key community practices?</h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Key practices include strict adherence to Genesis Nutrition, observance of the weekly Sabbath (including fasting), celebration of biblical Holy Days and unique Kingdom Celebrations, modest dress, communal living and work structures, education within the Kingdom School in Holiness, natural childbirth in the House of Life, and governance by the Divine Council according to divine law. Emphasis is placed on righteousness, self-sufficiency, community unity, and living in harmony with natural cycles.
