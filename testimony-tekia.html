                Emah Tekia arrived in Israel in 1969 and became one of the first midwives in the community. She has delivered hundreds of babies in the House of Life and trained generations of Divine Healers.

                    "The wilderness of Liberia stripped away everything that connected us to Babylon. Through driver ants, venomous snakes, and torrential rains, we were purified—prepared for our divine purpose. Those who remained became truly impregnable in spirit."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "When I first arrived in Israel, we faced so many challenges. We had little money, limited housing, and authorities who didn't understand who we were or why we had come. But we had something more powerful than material resources—we had faith in Yah's promises and the leadership of our Father Ben Ammi."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "As a young woman, I was called to serve the community as a midwife. We had no formal medical training as understood by the Western world, but we had knowledge passed down through generations and divine guidance in how to assist women in childbirth."

                 <blockquote class="quote my-6 text-lg"> <!-- Use quote class -->
                    "Humans are the only creatures who go to hospitals to deliver. Delivery is a natural thing. Our women eat according to the High Holy and Sacred Diet during pregnancy, their bodies are strong, and births happen as Yah intended—without drugs or unnecessary interventions."
                </blockquote>
                 <p>
                    "In the early days, we delivered babies in small apartments, sometimes with limited water or electricity. Yet we never lost a mother, and our babies thrived. Today, I've delivered children who have grown up to have their own children delivered in the same natural way. This is the power of living according to divine law."
                </p>
                 <p>
                    "Through the House of Life, we've shown the world that when you follow Yah's nutrition and health laws, childbirth returns to being a joyful, sacred experience rather than a medical emergency. Thousands of babies have been born in our community through natural methods, and these children grow up healthy, strong, and free of the diseases that plague outside society."
                </p>
                 <p>
                    "This is my testimony to the world: return to Yah's ways, and He will restore your health and give you children of promise."
