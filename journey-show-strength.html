                    A pivotal moment in the community's history occurred during Passover 1986, known as **The Great Show of Strength**. After years of facing deportations and legal uncertainty, the community planned their annual Passover pilgrimage to Jerusalem. However, Israeli authorities surrounded the Village of Peace in Dimona, intending to prevent their departure and potentially carry out mass deportations.

                <p>
                    Faced with this direct confrontation, H.E. Ben Ammi made a profound public declaration of faith and instructed the community not to resist physically. Instead, he called for a **five-day fast**, demonstrating reliance on spiritual power rather than worldly force.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    As documented by Ambassador Ahmadiel Ben Yehuda and other witnesses, the world watched as the community engaged in intense prayer and fasting. This non-violent response, rooted in deep spiritual conviction, ultimately shifted the dynamic. The authorities backed down, and the confrontation de-escalated without violence.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    The Great Show of Strength became a defining moment, showcasing the community's "impregnable" spiritual natureâ€”their ability to withstand immense pressure through faith and unity. It marked a turning point in public perception and demonstrated the power of spiritual resistance, paving the way for eventual legal recognition.
