                Prince Gavriel Ha Gadol was among the first to arrive in Israel in August 1969, together with Emah Tekia and their son Beninu. As author of "The Impregnable People," he has chronicled the community's journey from spiritual death to resurrection.

                    "I was born George Butler at the tail end of the Great Depression, on February 28, 1937, in Delhi, Louisiana. Like many Black children of that era, I grew up without understanding my true identity or purpose. The America I knew offered only a corrupted vision of who we were as a people—descendants of slaves with no connection to our ancestral heritage."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Everything changed when I encountered the divine vision that H.E. Ben Ammi received in 1966. Here was the answer to the spiritual longing that had haunted me for years—a call to return to our true identity as Hebrew Israelites and to establish Yah's Kingdom on earth."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "When I joined that first exodus from America in 1967, I had no idea of the trials that awaited us in the Liberian wilderness. Venomous snakes, driver ants, torrential rains, and diseases tested our resolve daily. Many turned back, unable to endure the purification process. But those of us who remained were being forged into something new—the impregnable people."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In August 1969, I was among the first to set foot in the Holy Land—the first Hebrew Israelites to return after nearly 2,000 years of exile. As I felt the sacred soil beneath my feet, I knew with certainty that prophecy was being fulfilled through our lives."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The next twenty years would test us beyond imagination. I was deported multiple times, separated from my family, faced economic hardship, and witnessed the systematic opposition of governments intent on removing us from the land. Yet through it all, one truth remained constant: Yah was with us."
                </p>
                 <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-6 text-lg">
                    "When I look at our community today—the Village of Peace, our healthy children and grandchildren, the international recognition we've received—I see not just our accomplishment but divine vindication. We were ex-Negroes from America's ghettos—people systematically stripped of identity, dignity, and strength. Now we stand as Hebrew Israelites firmly established in the Holy Land, unbroken despite decades of opposition. This transformation is the true miracle. This is why I declare with absolute certainty: Yah Khai! Yah lives!"
