                <p>
                    In 1971, the African Hebrew Israelite community embraced a revelation that would transform our physical and spiritual wellbeing—a return to the original diet prescribed by Yah in Genesis. This <strong>preventative and regenerative</strong> approach, known as <strong>Genesis Nutrition</strong>, has eliminated common diseases and created generations of vibrant, healthy Saints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Genesis Nutrition system focuses not merely on treating illness but on <strong>preventing disease</strong> through living foods that regenerate the body at the cellular level. Unlike the Western "death-style" that degenerates health over time, our plant-based approach actively restores vitality, reverses damage, and maintains optimal function throughout life.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold gold-text mt-6 mb-3">The Transition and Breakthrough</h2>
                <p>
                    The transition wasn't easy. In those early years, we faced nutritional challenges as we learned to balance our plant-based diet. Some of our babies developed health issues, and many adults experienced detoxification symptoms as centuries of dietary corruption were cleansed from our bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The breakthrough came through divine guidance and the discovery of healing herbs like <strong>fenugreek</strong>, which Prince Gavriel introduced to the community. This bitter herb, which the Chinese philosopher said "blessed is the man who crosses its path," became a cornerstone of our nutritional approach, known affectionately as <strong>"Love Powder"</strong>. Along with other natural foods, it restored our health and vitality.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold gold-text mt-6 mb-3">Remarkable Health Transformations</h2>
                <p>
                    Through decades of implementation, we've witnessed remarkable health transformations, including:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><span class="gold-text mr-2">•</span>Children born and raised in the community who have never experienced common Western diseases.</li>
                    <li><span class="gold-text mr-2">•</span>Elders who maintain active, vibrant lifestyles well into their golden years.</li>
                    <li><span class="gold-text mr-2">•</span>Natural childbirth through our House of Life with exceptional outcomes.</li>
                    <li><span class="gold-text mr-2">•</span>Recovery from diseases that conventional medicine considers incurable.</li>
                    <li><span class="gold-text mr-2">•</span>Enhanced mental clarity and spiritual receptivity through pure nutrition.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold gold-text mt-6 mb-3">Living Proof</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, our community stands as living proof of Genesis Nutrition's power. With virtually no instances of common Western diseases, natural childbirth through our House of Life, and elders who maintain vibrant health well past expected ages, we demonstrate what happens when a people return to the Creator's original design.
