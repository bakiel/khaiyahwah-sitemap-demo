            <blockquote class="text-lg italic text-center text-gray-600 my-6">
                "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat." — Genesis 1:29

                <p>
                    In 1971, the African Hebrew Israelite community embraced a revelation that would transform our physical and spiritual wellbeing—a return to the original diet prescribed by Yah in Genesis. This **preventative and regenerative** approach, known as **Genesis Nutrition**, has eliminated common diseases and created generations of vibrant, healthy Saints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Genesis Nutrition system focuses not merely on treating illness but on **preventing disease** through living foods that regenerate the body at the cellular level. Unlike the Western "death-style" that degenerates health over time, our plant-based approach actively restores vitality, reverses damage, and maintains optimal function throughout life.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">The Transition and Breakthrough</h2>
                <p>
                    The transition wasn't easy. In those early years, we faced nutritional challenges as we learned to balance our plant-based diet. Some of our babies developed health issues, and many adults experienced detoxification symptoms as centuries of dietary corruption were cleansed from our bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The breakthrough came through divine guidance and the discovery of healing herbs like **fenugreek**, which Prince Gavriel introduced to the community. This bitter herb, which the Chinese philosopher said "blessed is the man who crosses its path," became a cornerstone of our nutritional approach, known affectionately as **"Love Powder"**. Along with other natural foods, it restored our health and vitality.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Remarkable Health Transformations</h2>
                <p>
                    Through decades of implementation, we've witnessed remarkable health transformations, including:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
                    <li>Children born and raised in the community who have never experienced common Western diseases.</li>
                    <li>Elders who maintain active, vibrant lifestyles well into their golden years.</li>
                    <li>Natural childbirth through our House of Life with exceptional outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Recovery from diseases that conventional medicine considers incurable.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced mental clarity and spiritual receptivity through pure nutrition.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3">Living Proof</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, our community stands as living proof of Genesis Nutrition's power. With virtually no instances of common Western diseases, natural childbirth through our House of Life, and elders who maintain vibrant health well past expected ages, we demonstrate what happens when a people return to the Creator's original design.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-4">
                    "What we eat is a reflection of who we are spiritually. By returning to the original diet given to Adam, we are making a powerful statement about our identity and our commitment to aligning with Yah's perfect will for humanity."<br>
                    — H.E. Ben Ammi
