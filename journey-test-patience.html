                <p>
                    Following the establishment of the Divine Council, the community entered a prolonged period known as **The Test of Patience**. Spanning over a decade, this era was marked by significant external opposition and internal challenges that tested the faith and resilience of the Saints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The community faced intense **legal challenges** regarding their status in Israel. Authorities questioned their identity and right to remain in the land, leading to deportations, visa denials, and constant uncertainty. Economic hardship was prevalent, as access to formal employment was often restricted.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    Despite these pressures, the community demonstrated remarkable **perseverance**. Guided by the leadership of H.E. Ben Ammi and the Divine Council, they maintained their spiritual practices, strengthened their internal institutions (like the Kingdom School and House of Life), and developed self-sufficient economic activities within the Village of Peace.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    Throughout this testing period, the community experienced numerous instances of **divine protection and provision**, reinforcing their belief that Yah was sustaining them according to His covenant promises. This era forged an "impregnable" spirit, proving their ability to withstand external pressures while remaining faithful to their divine mission.
